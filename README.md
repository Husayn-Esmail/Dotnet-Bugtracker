# Bug Tracker

## Description
This is an application to track issues, while it coule be used for software <br>
bugs it doesn't necessarily have to. My intention for this project is to learn <br>
dotnet development and authentication.

## Technical Details
Languages: C# <br>
Design Pattern: MVC (Model-View-Controller)<br>
Frameworks: ASP.NET 6 <br>
Packages: 
- Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SQLite
- Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design
- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation

Cool feature ideas that could be added in the future:
- A "suggested" section that recommends certain issues based on previous 
  usage (machine learning)
